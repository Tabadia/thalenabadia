* **Instant Page:** It loads the page just before user clicks the link, reducing the page load time.
* **Google Fonts:** Google fonts are also seen as render-blocking so this feature helps load Google fonts asynchronously.

* **Advanced Combine JS:** Combines JS files placed in the footer section helping reduce HTTP calls.
* **Render blocking JS:** Before rendering a page the browser parses the HTML to create a DOM tree and if an external script comes it has to stop and wait for the script to execute hence the rendering of the page ends up taking time, hence Render blocking JS feature helps in deferring the load of JS after the render has happened hence the first load get faster.

SpeedyCache caches the website by creating static files on the server and delivers those static files to most of the users who visit the website, The static files eliminate the heavy load of Querying the database for data hence the load of your website is faster.

You can preload as many pages as you want, and preloading caches the website in regular intervals of time to reduce the load on the server.

Deleting Cache on New/updating Post.
You can decide to delete the cache on the creation or updating of a post so that the cache can always stay updated.
